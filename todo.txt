To do:
big stuff:
deal with cars/info that DNE -- BAD USER INPUT!!!
GRAPHS! --> this page isn't really responsive --> create diff mobile layout
sanitize input -- are we good on this?
typeahead? distance/other routes? year??

easy stuff:
about.html -- still should be better
validate html5 (and css?) --> done, but might need to re check
remove extra files/node modules (eg validator if we dont use)
