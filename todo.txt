It's probably more helpful to start working on a big thing and own it than to
just work on an easy thing.


To do:
big stuff:
deal with cars/info that DNE
deal with queries and stuff
figure out how to present the best options for the user
mobile interface -- Max
sanitize input -- George
graphs -- max/victor --> look at halligan helper source code
cookies/local storage -- victor

easy stuff:
about.html
make the whole thing look good
validate html5 (and css?)

eventually:
switch to live mygasfeed API (key on asana)
finalize google maps API stuff/gas stations, etc

Pick 5:
Geolocation
mongodb
client side data persistence
bootstrap
charts/graphs

required:
mobile UI (media queries)
gasbuddy + google maps at least 2 apis
