	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>We use cars to move around. Anyone who owns a car spends a significant part of their budget on gas. Filling up our cars with gas also takes time out of our busy lives. <p>

	<p>There are many resources available to help find the retail price of gas; there are also many location-based apps to help consumers find the closest gas station. GasBuddy is a popular tool to find cheap gas stations, but we forget about many of the other costs associated with filling up, especially the cost of the gas it takes to get to a gas station. Other factors include time and how much gas we need to put in our tanks. FuelMeUp will help people make informed decisions so they can save time and money. <p>
