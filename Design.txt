Project Title: GMoney

Problem statement: 

We use cars to move around. Anyone who owns a car spends a significant part of their budget on gas. Filling up our cars with gas also takes time out of our busy lives.

There are many resources available to help find the retail price of gas; there are also many location-based apps to help consumers find the closest gas station. GasBuddy is a popular tool to find cheap gas stations, but we forget about many of the other costs associated with filling up, especially the cost of the gas it takes to get to a gas station. Other factors include time and how much gas we need to put in our tanks. GMoney will help people make informed decisions so they can save time and money.

Solution: 

Weight function for graph
w = retail (# gals to fill + ((d1 + d2)/mpg))
Default: d1 == d2
retail is in $ / gal
number gals to fill = f * tank capacity


Features:

- Enter car type
- Enter destination (optional; default: roundtrip from current location)
- Enter type of gas (optional; default: regular)
