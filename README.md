Fuel Me Up
===================

### Problem Statement

We use cars to move around. Anyone who owns a car spends a significant part of their budget on gas. Filling up our cars with gas also takes time out of our busy lives.

### Solution

Unlike simple price comparison tools, FuelMeUp will help people make informed decisions by calculating the *real* cost of driving to fill up their tanks, so they can save time and money.
